# RTS_Map_Generator
Generator of maps for real-time strategy games
The generator will include:
- Selection from different land types (single continent, set number of islands, combined)
- Different biomes to place on the map
- Availability of setting the weights of biomes -> make some biomes appear more often than others
- Random height placement
- Different natural resources to place on the map
- Availability to download the maps (with legends)

Please note that it's a generator, not a constructor :) Everything I've mentioned here will be either in-built (like height placement) or the user will be allowed to select something for the program to place (resources, biomes, world types)
